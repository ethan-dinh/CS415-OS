This repository contains all of the project files and solutions for the
University of Oregon CS 415 Class. The class description is as follows:

* Operating systems are undergoing a renaissance of interest within computer science. With the rise of open-source operating systems such as Linux and the BSD distributions, the commodification of operating system functionality through cloud computing, and the new approaches to device management from smartphone and tablet-based operating systems such as Android and Apple iOS, an understanding of operating system fundamentals is perhaps more important than ever. Knowledge of the theory and practice of operating system design is also a fundamental prerequisite for understanding critical systems issues such as networking and security.

* This course is an introduction to the theory and practice behind modern computer operating systems. Topics will include what an operating system does (and doesn't) do, system calls and interfaces, processes, concurrent programming, resource scheduling and management (e.g., CPU, memory, devices), virtual memory, deadlocks, and security. We will approach the subject from both a theoretical perspective (what are the abstractions and algorithms?) as well as a practical one (what are the mechanisms and how are they built?). A detailed list of lecture by lecture contents, assignments, and due dates (subject to change as the term evolves) is available from the Canvas syllabus.
