Current State of Submission:
        Every part of the program was implemented. In its current state, both str_malloc and str_free functions properly and are both thread safe. When tested for memory leaks via valgrind, all test programs returned 0 bytes in use at exit. Further there are no warnings or errors during compilation and valgrind execution.
