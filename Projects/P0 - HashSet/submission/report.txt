Current state of submission: the set was implemented a hash table. In its
current state, the program compiles successfully and when tested using longtest
and stringtest, the program successfully passes all tests. It was also checked
for memory leaks both using the provided tests and an additional test in which
more than 100 unique items were added to the set.
